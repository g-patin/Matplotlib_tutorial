# Matplotlib_tutorial

This repository contains didactic information on how to use the Matplotlib package to create visualizations. In the notebook named *tutorial_matplotlib*, you will find a list of plotting examples. The notebook makes use of the data stored in the excel file (fake_microfading_data.xlsx), so make sure to have the excel file in the same directory as the notebook.

Inside the notebook, use the table of contents to search for a desired output or topic. If the question you have about Matplotlib is not treated in the notebook, please let me know and I will add a new section about it in the notebook.

Goodluck !
